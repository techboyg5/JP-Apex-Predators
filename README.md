# LOTR Converter

This is an iOS app written in Swift that allows you explore, sort, and filter different predators in the Jurassic Park universe.

I developed this app as part of [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-15-app-development-with-swiftui-3-and-swift-5/). I highly recommend getting it if you're interested in learning iOS app development!
